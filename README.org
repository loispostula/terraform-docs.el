* ~terraform-docs.el~
An Emacs package for seamlessly integrating [[https://terraform-docs.io/][terraform-docs]] into your workflow. This package provides utilities for generating [[https://terraform.io][Terraform]] documentation from your modules, with options to view the output in a buffer, write it to a file, or both.

* Installation

You can install =terraform-mode.el= from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] by =package.el=.

* Features
- *Customizable Configuration File:*
  Specify the configuration file name for =terraform-docs= (default: =.terraform-docs.yml=).
- *Flexible Output Options:*
  - Display the generated documentation in a popup buffer.
  - Save the documentation to a dynamically named file.
  - Save the documentation to a file and open it immediately in Emacs.
- *Automatic File Naming:*
  Output files are named dynamically based on the module directory name, using the format =output-for-<module-directory>.md=.

* Usage
** Commands
1. *Run with Default Behavior:*
   Runs =terraform-docs= using the configuration file and user-defined output settings:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   M-x terraform-docs
   #+end_src

2. *Output to a Temporary Buffer:*
   Runs =terraform-docs= and displays the output in a temporary buffer:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   M-x terraform-docs-to-buffer
   #+end_src

3. *Output to a File:*
   Generates documentation and writes it to a file in the module directory:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   M-x terraform-docs-to-file
   #+end_src

4. *Output to a File and Open:*
   Generates documentation, writes it to a file, and opens the file in Emacs:
